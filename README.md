# ZykePanel
ZykePanel is a dashboard/panel for Discord Bots created with the help of Discord.js.  

## Usage
ZykePanel can be used with any Discord Bot that you have access to it's token.  

You will need to visit [the official website](https://panel.zyke.me) or [download the files](https://github.com/ZykeNetwork/ZykePanel/archive/master.zip) and upload them to your website, and then visit it.  
Upon visiting it, you will be asked to enter your bot's token. Paste it on the textbox and then you will gain access.  

You can now use the functions present such as sending messages as the bot and chatting, making it leave a server, deleting it's messages and so on. Have fun!
